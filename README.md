As a Bachelor’s degree student in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, I am passionate about exploring the intersection of these two fields. I am particularly interested in the integration of blockchain technology with robotics to improve AI services and solve problems that are present in major blockchains. I believe that this integration can lead to the creation of robotic systems with increased capabilities and security.

My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in robotics and artificial intelligence, which I have supplemented with independent research on blockchain technology. I have gained experience in developing blockchain-based applications and have worked on several projects that involve integrating blockchain technology with robotics.

I am excited to continue exploring this field and contributing to it in the future. My goal is to leverage my knowledge and skills to develop innovative solutions that can help solve real-world problems.

Thank you for considering my application. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work.
